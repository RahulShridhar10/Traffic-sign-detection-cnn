# Traffic-sign-detection-cnn
I have created a python project with deep learning with cnn  to detect traffic signs. This is a most used feature in ADAS vehicles . I have used tensorflow and open cv
I'm not gonna lie that this is 100% accurate. I have tried adding layers and activation functions by myself i'm still modifying changes to improve the model.
